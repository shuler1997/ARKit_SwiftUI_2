# ARKit_SwiftUI_2

This is the second version of the project, I built this project from scratch. Please run the code. After it loads, tap on "To AR View", and then "generate Node". A SwiftUI View should be rendered

The button in the SwiftUI View shouldn't be interactive, and there should be no issues going back and forth between the VCs by tapping on "back" and "To AR View" again.

To Summarise, my need is to figure out the difference in code which underlies the difference that we're observing between the 2 versions of the app so I can hopefully find a way of switching between the two states.
